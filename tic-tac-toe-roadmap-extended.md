# Tic Tac Toe Project Roadmap ✅

A structured checklist to guide the development of your TypeScript-based Tic Tac Toe browser game.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Setup

- [x] `index.html` with basic structure
- [x] `main.ts` as the app entry point
- [x] Initialize TypeScript and Vite
- [x] Create `src/types/types.ts` for shared types

---

## 🎮 Phase 2: Game State & Rendering

- [x] `game/gameState.ts` – manage the board array and moves
- [x] `ui/renderer.ts` – render the board based on game state
- [x] `ui/events.ts` – add event listeners for clicks
- [x] Player turn handling in `main.ts`

## 🧪 Phase 7: Testing

- [ ] Set up test framework (e.g., Vitest or Jest)
- [ ] Write unit tests for `gameRules.ts`

- [ ] Write integration tests for user interactions
- [ ] Add basic end-to-end test (e.g., using Playwright or Cypress)

---

## 📚 Phase 8: Documentation

- [ ] Add README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Document all functions in code using comments or JSDoc
- [ ] Create architecture overview (folder structure explanation)
- [ ] Add usage instructions for different modes (human vs human, vs AI)
- [ ] Include contribution guidelines (if open source)

---

## 🚀 Phase 9: Deployment

- [ ] Build production-ready app using `vite build`
- [ ] Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
- [ ] Add custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Add favicon and meta tags for better SEO/sharing
- [ ] Enable PWA support (optional installable app)
