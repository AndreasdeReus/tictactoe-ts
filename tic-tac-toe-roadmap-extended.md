## 🏗️ Phase 1: Setup

- [x] `index.html` with basic structure

- [x] Initialize TypeScript and Vite
- [x] Create `src/types/types.ts` for shared types

---

## 🎮 Phase 2: Game State & Rendering

- [x] `game/gameState.ts` – manage the board array and moves

---

## 📚 Phase 8: Documentation

- [ ] Add README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Document all functions in code using comments or JSDoc
- [ ] Create architecture overview (folder structure explanation)
- [ ] Add usage instructions for different modes (human vs human, vs AI)
- [ ] Include contribution guidelines (if open source)

---

## 🚀 Phase 9: Deployment

- [ ] Build production-ready app using `vite build`
- [ ] Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
